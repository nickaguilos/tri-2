						TRI/Environmental, Inc. (TRI) is a full-service independent laboratory serving a variety of related polymer-centric industries around the world. At our core is a deep understanding of polymeric materials and the characteristics critical to performance. TRI tests, certifies, performs research, develops equipment and provides consulting on plastic materials used in civil, environmental and geotechnical engineering as well as protective clothing.
					</p>

					<p>
						Materials including geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, geotextiles, geogrids, geocells, plastic pipe, rolled erosion control products, protective clothing and the like have been tested by TRI for over three decades. However, our knowledge and understanding goes deeper than just testing… TRI performs research, develops test equipment, develops standards and provides education for each of the industries it serves.
					</p>

					<p>
						TRI’s personnel are active throughout the world’s standards development organizations and routinely provide short courses, seminars and tailor-made training services.
